# Report coverage results using coveralls. The script is executed with these

#
#   $1 - full path to environment python
#   $2 - full path to system python
#
# coveralls is executed only if $1 coincides with $2 and $1's environment is
# stable, i.e. TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION is of the form [:digit:] "." [:digit:]
# (this prevents running coveralls more then once in the case if both X.Y and
# X.Y-dev coincides with system python which version is also X.Y). The results
# are reported only if LSR_PUBLISH_COVERAGE is non-empty.
